            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Clarity & Insight:</strong> Our primary goal is to make complex topics understandable. Submissions should aim to clarify, explain, and provide actionable insights, rather than just report facts.</li>
                <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> We cover current events, social issues, technology, lifestyle, and personal growth â€“ always through the lens of providing clarity and deeper understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Beyond the Headline:</strong> We seek pieces that explain the "why" and "how," offering context and implications that readers won't find in a quick news scroll.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance & Objectivity (where applicable):</strong> For analytical or explanatory pieces, strive for balanced perspectives and present information fairly. Our aim is to inform, not to persuade with bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Originality:</strong> We prefer original thought, unique angles, and fresh perspectives on established topics.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Accessible & Engaging:</strong> Write for a broad audience. Avoid jargon where possible, and if technical terms are necessary, explain them clearly. Your writing should be engaging, conversational, and easy to follow.</li>
                <li><strong>Concise & Direct:</strong> Every word should earn its place. Get straight to the point and avoid unnecessary fluff. Remember our promise to cut through the clutter.</li>
                <li><strong>Authoritative yet Approachable:</strong> Demonstrate expertise without being condescending. Be confident in your knowledge, but maintain a tone that invites readers in.</li>
                <li><strong>Kumple News Voice:</strong> While we value individual voices, aim for a consistent standard of professionalism and clarity that aligns with the Kumple News brand.</li>
